## 8. Testing & Validation üß™

### End-to-End Authentication Test

**Full Flow:**
1. [ ] New user signs up via mobile app
2. [ ] Email verification received and confirmed
3. [ ] APPI consent modal appears
4. [ ] User provides consent
5. [ ] Consent saved to database and Cognito
6. [ ] User can sign in
7. [ ] JWT token received
8. [ ] GraphQL queries authenticated successfully
9. [ ] User data appears in PostgreSQL
10. [ ] Audit logs recorded in CloudWatch

### Security Validation

```bash
# Verify password policy enforcement
# Try creating user with weak password - should fail

# Verify JWT claims
# Decode token and check for APPI compliance claims
```

- [ ] Weak passwords rejected
- [ ] JWT includes custom APPI claims
- [ ] Tokens expire after 60 minutes
