sections:
  - id: overview
    title: Overview
    overview: This document outlines all technical features and functionality for {{project_name}}. 
      It should serve as a technical implementation roadmap for the {{project_name}} app and 
      web dashboard, stemming from the Project Brief (brief.md).
  - id: context
    title: Background Context
    instruction: |
      Ask if Project Brief document is available. If NO Project Brief exists, STRONGLY recommend creating one first and HALT. 
      If Project Brief exists, review and use it to populate Goals (bullet list of desired outcomes) and Background 
      Context (1-2 paragraphs on what this solves and why) so we can determine what is and is not in scope for PDRD mvp. 
      Either way this is critical to determine the requirements.
    sections:
      - id: goals
        title: Goals
        type: bullet-list
        instruction: Bullet list of 1 line desired outcomes the PDRD will deliver if successful - user and project desires
      - id: background
        title: Background Context
        type: paragraphs
        instruction: | 
          1-2 short paragraphs summarizing the background context, such as what we learned in the brief without being 
          redundant with the goals, what and why this solves a problem, what the current landscape or need is

  - id: phases
    title: Development Phases
    instruction: |
      Use the Project Brief to think about and outline each of the phases of the product development 
      cycle needed to produce a working and viable MVP for {{project_name}}.
      
      Each phase will consist of one or more features needed to fully implement the phase. These features are 
      outlined in the mvp-features section of this document. Phases should be prioritized by legal and compliance 
      needs, technical implementation dependencies, business value towards an MVP, and backend infrastructure 
      requirements. Populate the phases child section with the phases outlined.

            title: Why Critical
            type: paragraph
            instruction: write a concise but comprehensive statement outlining why this phase is critical to the overall success of {{project_name}}

  - id: mvp-features
    title: MVP Features
    instruction: |
      For each phase outlined in the phases section of this document, Think about and outline each of 
      the features needed to fully implement and meet all of the requirements of that phase.

      Features should be prioritized by legal and compliance needs, technical dependencies and 
      backend infrastructure requirements. Populate the features child section with the features you outline.
      Each feature will have a check next to it denoting whether it has been selected for implementation or not.
    sections:
      - id: features
        title: Feature List
        type: checklist
        choices:
          priority: [Critical, High, Medium, Low]
          implemented: [True|False]

          - id: priority
            title: Feature Priority
            priority: "{Critical|High|Medium|Low}"
          - id: dependencies
            title: Technical Dependency
            instruction: If this feature depends on other features or technical aspects, define them here.
          - id: phase
            title: Phase {{phase_name}}
            instruction: Add the name of the phase that this feature belongs to in the title property above.
          - id: description
            title: Description
            instruction: Write a detailed description of the feature.

            title: Key Components
            type: nested-list
            instruction: Create a nested list of the key components for this feature. Under each key component add another list further outlining aspects of the key component.
            example: 
              - Real-Time Translation
                  - Bidirectional Japanese â†” English translation
                  - Context-aware translation for rental terminology
                  - Conversation history with original and translated text

            title: Technical Implementation
            type: nested-list
            instruction: | 
              Create a nested list of the technical requirements needed to fully implement this feature.
              Keep it high-level and deliniate between frontend and backend requirements. Under each  
              requirement write out another list of the specific requirements or dependencies neede to 
              implement the parent requirement, if there are any.

  - id: review
    title: Review Report
    instruction: | 
      Have a deep think and ensure that no phases or features are dependent on completion of
      other phases or feature. In other words, phases and features should be in seqential order of technical dependencies. For example, a
      feature to update profile inforomation should not come before authentication features. Do this review and note down any revisions you
      made to the document here along with why you made those revisions.

   - id: checklist-results
    title: Checklist Results Report
    instruction: | 
      Before running the checklist, offer to output the full updated PDRD. If outputting it, confirm with the user 
      that you will be proceeding to run the checklist and produce the report. Once the user confirms, execute the pm-checklist and populate 
      the results in this section.
