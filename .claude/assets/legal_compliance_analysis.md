**Report Date:** August 2025  
**Prepared For:** Rento PropTech Startup Executive Team  
**Scope:** Japanese Legal & Regulatory Compliance Requirements  
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL - Executive Review  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Compliance Status: MODERATE RISK - FOCUSED ACTION REQUIRED

Rento's MVP business model as a **property search and discovery platform with agent subscription revenue** faces moderate compliance challenges primarily related to data privacy and business registration. This analysis identifies key requirements for operating a lead generation platform without transaction facilitation.

**MVP Launch Timeline:** 30-60 days for essential compliance  
**Estimated MVP Compliance Investment:** ¥1-2M initial, ¥2M annually  
**Legal Risk Level:** MODERATE - Data privacy compliance critical, transaction licensing not required for MVP  

### Key Compliance Requirements Summary

**MVP Lead Generation Platform:**
1. **Real Estate Transaction License (宅建業免許)** - **NOT REQUIRED** for pure search/discovery platform
2. **Cross-border Data Transfer Compliance** - CRITICAL VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED  
3. **Payment Processing License** - **NOT REQUIRED** for agent subscription model
4. **Business Registration & Basic Compliance** - REQUIRED
5. **Platform Terms & Disclaimers** - CRITICAL for license-free operation

**Future Transaction Features (Post-MVP):**
- Real Estate Transaction License required for rental facilitation
- Payment processing license for handling rental transactions - A license is not required for a subscription-based app in Japan, provided you use an established, third-party payment processor like those provided by app stores. However, you must still comply with Japanese regulations, including the Payment Services Act (PSA) and the Specified Commercial Transactions Act (SCTA). A license from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) under the Payment Services Act is typically required only when your company handles money directly, acting as a funds transfer service provider or operating your own prepaid payment instrument. This is not the case for most app developers, who rely on third-party payment systems. 
- Enhanced consumer protection compliance

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** MVP model significantly reduces regulatory burden. Primary focus: data privacy compliance and proper platform positioning to avoid transaction facilitation requirements.
