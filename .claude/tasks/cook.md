2. **Read Selected Task** - Review and understand the selected Todo task in its entirety. If there are task aspects that are unclear or ambigous for your purposes ask the user to clarify.
3. **Implement** - Obtain a clear understanding of the technical design and implementation of the selected task then implement it in the codebase. Rely on the user for any questions you may have or if you need additional support or clarification. Remember that you and the user both comprise the development team.
4. **Review** - Once you have implemented the task into the codebase ask the user to review. Provide the user with a brief summary of the changes and updates introduced into the codebase.
