# /cook Task

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

## CRITICAL: Archon Access

If you are unable to access Archon notify the user and ask them to check the MCP server connection. 
Wait for the user to tell you to either try to reconnect or to exit this task prematurely. If reconnect is successful continue with this task.

## Processing Flow: Run the following steps sequentially

1. **List Todo Tasks** - List ALL of the tasks in the Archon Rento project and ask the user to select one.
2. **Read Selected Task** - Review and understand the selected Todo task in its entirety.
3. **Implement** - Obtain a clear understanding of the technical design and implementation of the selected task then implement it in the codebase. Rely on the user for any questions you may have or if you need additional support or clarification. Remember that you and the user both comprise the development team.
4. **Review** - Once you have implemented the task into the codebase ask the user to review. Provide the user with a brief summary of the changes and updates introduced into the codebase.

## CRITICAL: Guidelines

When listing Archon tasks
- ONLY list the tasks in the TODO column
- List ALL of the tasks by title only
- Number each task

When implementing the feature oultined in the TDD, ALWAYS:

- Analyze and understand the entire codebase
- Ensure coding standards, design patterns, and architectural principles
- Stay within the scope of an MVP.
- If there are aspects of the codebase or TDD that are unclear or ambigous for your purposes ask the user to clarify.
