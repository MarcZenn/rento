## Task

Choose a feature to build from the `feature_list.md` file. Create a Product Requirement Document (PRD) for that feature. Use the PRD to create a Technical Design Document (TDD).
Run the following steps sequentially to accomplish this: 

1. Review the `feature_list.md` check list and identify the next uncompleted feature. 
2. Give this feature to the product-manager. Have the product-manager draft a product requirement document (PRD) for this feature. Save the PRD in the `.claude/assets/PRDs` directory.
3. Take that PRD and give it to the technical-architect to analyze and review. The technical-architect should provide you with one or more technical design documents (TDD). Depending on the work required to satisfy the PRD there may be a backend TDD, a frontend TDD or both. Save all TDDs in the `.claude/assets/TDDs` directory. Once the TDDs are completed and drafted mark them as `ready for review` at the top of each TDD file.
