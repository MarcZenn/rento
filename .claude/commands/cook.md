description: Update the codebase and add support a new application feature outlined in a Technical Design Document (TDD)
---

## Task

Implement a new feature following the implementation outlined in a new Technical Design Document (TDD). Run the following steps sequentially to accomplish this: 

1. Invoke the senior-frontend-engineer and senior-backend-engineer to review the Technical Design Document in the `/.claude/assets/TDDs/review` directory.
2. Next, Invoke the senior-backend-engineer and senior-frontend-engineer to begin implementing the TDD and updating the codebase. They should collaborate on any aspects of the Technical Design Document that require fullstack engineering input.
3. Move the TDD in the `/.claude/assets/TDDs/review` directory to the `/.claude/assets/TDDs/pending` directory.
