# Product Development Roadmap Document: Rento

## Overview

This document outlines all technical features and functionality for **Rento**. It should serve as a technical implementation roadmap for the Rento app and web dashboard, stemming from the Project Brief (brief.md).

## Background Context

### Goals

• Transform rental experience for foreign residents and Japanese renters through bilingual cultural bridge technology
• Eliminate language barriers and cultural navigation challenges in Japanese real estate transactions
• Simplify and modernize the rental apartment discovery process in Japan for both foreigners and residents
• Build sustainable agent partnership network with 50 certified bilingual agencies within 18 months
• Achieve ¥65M annual revenue by Year 3 through dual revenue streams (subscriptions + transaction fees)
• Establish market leadership in bilingual rental services with defensive competitive advantages
• Create scalable platform foundation for geographic expansion beyond Tokyo Metropolitan Area

### Background Context

Rento addresses critical gaps in Japan's ¥187 billion foreign resident rental market where existing platforms like SUUMO and LIFULL HOME'S provide only basic translation without cultural context. The platform combines bilingual service excellence with modern technology to serve 260,000+ foreign rental households in Tokyo who currently face discrimination, communication barriers, and 2-4 weeks additional search time. Younger residents of Japan deal with complex processes, beauracracy and an analaog and difficult methods when searching for rental apartments. 

The solution leverages Japan's digital transformation momentum and government immigration policies targeting 2M additional foreign workers by 2030. With a 12-18 month competitive window before major platforms develop comprehensive responses, Rento's cultural expertise positioning creates defensible advantages beyond pure technology features, justified by foreign residents' willingness to pay 10-20% premium for specialized services.

**Technical differentiation through APPI compliance** creates substantial competitive barriers while justifying premium agent pricing. Self-hosted infrastructure requirements (¥300K-500K monthly) and comprehensive data residency controls establish regulatory moats that protect market position once implemented, requiring competitors to make similar ¥3-5M compliance investments.

## Development Phases

### Implementation Phases

#### [ ] Phase 1: Foundation & Compliance Infrastructure

**Objectives:**
• Establish APPI-compliant self-hosted infrastructure on Japanese cloud services
• Implement core authentication and user management systems with data residency controls
• Set up development, and production environments with audit logging
• Create basic bilingual UI framework and i18n internationalization system

**Technical Requirements:**
• Self-hosted PostgresSQL database on AWS Tokyo (ap-northeast-1) with Redis caching layer for performance optimization
• AWS Cognito+Amplify authentication system in Tokyo region for APPI-compliant identity management
• GraphQL+Apollo Server API layer providing unified interface between React Native/web clients and PostgresSQL/Amplify backend
• End-to-end encryption implementation for sensitive user data and communications
• Comprehensive audit logging system for regulatory compliance and data access tracking
• React Native mobile app foundation with Apollo Client for GraphQL operations and AWS Amplify SDK
• Agent web dashboard using React.js with Apollo Client for real-time GraphQL subscriptions

**GraphQL API Architecture:**
• Apollo Server middleware handling AWS Cognito JWT verification and user context creation
• GraphQL resolvers calling functions for database operations with APPI compliance validation
• Real-time subscriptions for agent-customer messaging and property updates
• GraphQL schema supporting bilingual content with cultural context fields

**Why Critical:**
This phase establishes the fundamental technical and regulatory foundation required for all subsequent features. Without APPI compliance and secure infrastructure, the platform cannot legally operate in Japan or build trust with privacy-conscious real estate agents. The bilingual framework created here enables all user-facing features while the authentication system supports both customer and agent workflows essential for marketplace functionality.

#### [ ] Phase 2: Core Property Discovery Platform

**Objectives:**
• Implement comprehensive property search with Japan-specific filters and location intelligence
• Create bilingual property detail pages with cultural context translation capabilities
• Build interactive map interface optimized for Tokyo's complex transportation system
• Establish property data integration pipeline from real estate agency sources

**Technical Requirements:**
• Geospatial indexing system for property location search with commute time calculations
• Real-time translation API integration (DeepL, Google Translate) with rental terminology optimization
• Property media management system supporting high-resolution images (and virtual tour integration past MVP)
• Advanced search filtering for Japanese rental requirements (key money, guarantor systems, pet policies)
• Responsive map interface with neighborhood exploration and transportation overlay features
• Property data synchronization pipeline with real estate agency APIs and manual upload capabilities

**Why Critical:**
Property discovery represents the core value proposition that attracts users to the platform and differentiates Rento from existing solutions. The cultural translation and Japan-specific filters address primary user pain points while the advanced search capabilities provide competitive advantages over traditional platforms. This phase creates the foundation for user acquisition and engagement essential for marketplace growth.

#### [ ] Phase 3: Agent Communication & Relationship Management

**Objectives:**
• Deploy real-time messaging system with integrated translation for agent-customer communication
• Create comprehensive agent web-based dashboard for property management and customer relationship tracking
• Implement inquiry tracking and response management workflow for professional service delivery
• Establish tiered agent partnership model with optional cultural competency certification

**Technical Requirements:**
• Real-time messaging infrastructure with WebSocket connections and offline message delivery
• Integrated translation system maintaining conversation context and rental terminology accuracy
• Agent web-based dashboard with property listing management, customer inquiry tracking, performance analytics & real-time messaging
• Notification system respecting cultural communication preferences and business hour constraints
• Customer relationship management tools for agents including preference tracking and follow-up scheduling
• Optional cultural competency certification system with tiered agent benefits and pricing

**Why Critical:**
Agent relationships represent the marketplace's supply side and revenue generation through subscription fees. Professional communication tools and optional cultural competency certification create tiered agent partnerships that reduce acquisition friction while maintaining competitive differentiation. This phase enables the dual-sided marketplace model essential for sustainable business growth and competitive positioning against traditional rental platforms.

**Phase Gate Requirements:**
- **Phase 1 → 2 Gate**: APPI compliance audit passed, authentication system load tested with 100+ concurrent users
- **Phase 2 → 3 Gate**: 500+ active users achieved, translation accuracy >85% validated, property engagement metrics (avg 15+ searches per user) confirmed
- **Cross-phase validation**: Continuous integration testing between phase components with automated dependency verification

**Dependency Risk Mitigation:**
- Translation system designed in Phase 2 with conversation context capabilities required for Phase 3
- Agent pilot program contingency allows Phase 3 start with minimum 100 power users if broader adoption delayed
- Quantified success metrics prevent premature phase transitions that could compromise marketplace development
