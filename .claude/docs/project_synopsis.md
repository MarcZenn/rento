## Market Problem

Japan‚Äôs property rental market is largely inaccessible for foreigners and notoriously complex in general. At the same time, Japan thrives on trust. Due to this and other factors, foreigners often face discrimination, excessive upfront costs (key money, deposits), and language barriers. Young Japanese renters also struggle with outdated processes, lack of transparency and trust, and overwhelming documentation.

## Proposed Solution

Rento simplifies the rental process, removes language and cultural barriers, and modernizes property discovery and communication ‚Äî all in one unified platform.

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR:** There are two core foundational needs that must be in place in order to enable all subsequent business development: 
    1. MVP launch with working legal compliance systems in place. MVP must be a compliant, functional platform.
    2. Real-estate agent partnerships must be in place prior to user growth. This means we need real-estate agents to upload properties onto the platform (for free at first) so that we can then go pursue an aggresive user signups campaign.
