# Business Concept

A mobile application named Rento. The purpose of this application is to allow foreigners and native residents to find, evaluate and discover rental properties in Japan via a simple mobile app with a clean and simple, yet informative, UI/UX. 

# Logline 

Rento is real-estate mobile app that helps foreigners and native residents discover rental apartments in Japan.

## Core Requirements
- It must be a mobile app
- The app must be supported on both iOS and Android
- The app must be fully compliant with Japanese Data Protection laws, Privacy laws and user consent requirements
- The app must be fully internationalized and bilingual (English and Japanese) with future multilingual support.

- The app must be intuitive and simple to use. It must appeal to both Japanese natives and foreigners.
- The app must have map-based, apartment discovery and search with various filtering options relevant to the Japanese real-estate rental market.

## Market Problem

Japan’s property rental market is largely inaccessible for foreigners and notoriously complex in general. At the same time, Japan thrives on trust. Due to this and other factors, foreigners often face discrimination, excessive upfront costs (key money, deposits), and language barriers. Young Japanese renters also struggle with outdated processes, lack of transparency and trust, and overwhelming documentation.

## Proposed Solution

Rento simplifies the rental process, removes language and cultural barriers, and modernizes property discovery and communication — all in one unified platform.

## Company Description

## Potential business partnerships:

- Weave Living - `https://www.weave-living.com/`
- The Founder Institute - `https://fi.co/join`
- E-Housing Japan - `https://e-housing.jp/`
- Unistyles includes custom native code, which means it does not support Expo Go. Therefore the app cannot be run locally use Expo Go. Instead we must create a development build and run the development build.
