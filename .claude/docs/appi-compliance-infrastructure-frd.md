# Feature Requirements Document: APPI Compliance Infrastructure

## Status

**Implemented:** False
**Platform:** Web

## Overview

**APPI Compliance Infrastructure - Feature Requirements Document**

## Background Context

### Goals
• Establish legal foundation for platform operation in Japan through comprehensive APPI compliance
• Create substantial competitive barrier requiring ¥3-5M investment from competitors to replicate
• Build trust foundation with privacy-conscious real estate agents essential for marketplace success
• Enable premium pricing justification through demonstrated regulatory leadership and data security excellence
• Ensure all personal data processing occurs within Japanese infrastructure boundaries with full audit capability

### Background Context

The APPI Compliance Infrastructure represents the foundational requirement for Rento's legal operation in Japan's heavily regulated data privacy landscape. This feature addresses the critical gap in existing rental platforms that lack comprehensive data residency controls and regulatory compliance monitoring, creating a defensive competitive advantage that requires substantial investment to replicate.

Without this infrastructure, Rento cannot legally process user data, handle real estate transactions, or build relationships with Japanese real estate agents who demand strict privacy compliance. The system establishes the technical and legal foundation upon which all other platform features depend, while creating a significant barrier to entry that protects market position once implemented.

## Requirements

**MVP SCOPE:** This document has been optimized for MVP delivery, focusing on essential compliance requirements while deferring advanced features to post-MVP phases. This approach reduces implementation time from 4-6 months to 2-3 months and operational costs from ¥300K-500K to ¥200K-300K monthly.

**FR3-MVP:** Basic audit logging system capturing critical data access events with 2-year retention (REDUCED SCOPE: 7-year retention deferred to post-MVP)
**FR4-MVP:** Simple user consent management with privacy preferences and withdrawal capability (REDUCED SCOPE: 5-minute processing cessation reduced to 1-hour for MVP)
**FR5-MVP:** Basic backup and disaster recovery within Japanese boundaries with 8-hour RTO (REDUCED SCOPE: 4-hour RTO deferred to post-MVP)
**FR6-MVP:** API gateway with request logging and essential security headers (REDUCED SCOPE: Advanced rate limiting deferred to post-MVP)

### Post-MVP Functional Requirements (Deferred)

**FR7-FUTURE:** Advanced role-based access control with comprehensive audit trails
**FR8-FUTURE:** Real-time compliance monitoring with automated alerting
**FR9-FUTURE:** Automated data retention policies and deletion workflows
**FR10-FUTURE:** Integration with Japanese regulatory reporting systems (manual reporting acceptable for MVP)
**FR11-FUTURE:** Synthetic data testing environment (staging with anonymized data sufficient for MVP)
**FR12-FUTURE:** Automated cost optimization algorithms (manual monitoring sufficient for MVP)

### MVP Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1-MVP:** Infrastructure must support 1,000+ concurrent users with sub-500ms response times (REDUCED SCOPE: 10,000 users deferred to post-MVP)
**NFR2-MVP:** System availability of 99% uptime with scheduled maintenance windows (REDUCED SCOPE: 99.9% uptime deferred to post-MVP)
**NFR3-MVP:** Data encryption at rest and in transit meeting Japanese banking security standards with quarterly key rotation (REDUCED SCOPE: Monthly rotation deferred)
**NFR4-MVP:** Audit log retention of 2 years with basic search capability (REDUCED SCOPE: 7-year retention and advanced indexing deferred)
**NFR5-MVP:** Maintain ¥200K-300K monthly operational budget for MVP phase (REDUCED SCOPE: Lower cost target for faster market entry)

### Post-MVP Non-Functional Requirements (Deferred)

**NFR6-FUTURE:** Real-time compliance violation detection (1-hour detection acceptable for MVP)
**NFR7-FUTURE:** Continuous data residency validation (daily validation checks sufficient for MVP)
**NFR8-FUTURE:** Advanced disaster recovery with 4-hour RTO (8-hour RTO acceptable for MVP)
**NFR9-FUTURE:** Accelerated compliance certification (longer timeline acceptable if needed)
**NFR10-FUTURE:** Full legacy system compatibility (focus on modern agency partners first)

## User Interface Design Goals

This feature primarily involves backend infrastructure with minimal direct user interface requirements. However, there are some user-facing elements:

### Overall UX Vision
Administrative dashboard for compliance monitoring and user consent management with bilingual interface supporting both technical teams and legal compliance officers.

### Key Interaction Paradigms (MVP)
- **Basic Compliance Dashboard:** Daily monitoring with essential violation alerts (real-time monitoring deferred)
- **Simple User Consent Interface:** Essential privacy controls with basic data sharing preferences
- **Basic Audit Interface:** Simple log viewing with manual export (advanced search deferred)

### Core Screens and Views (MVP)
- Basic Compliance Dashboard
- Simple User Privacy Settings Page
- Basic Audit Log Viewer

### Deferred Screens (Post-MVP)
- Advanced System Health Status Page
- Automated Incident Response Dashboard

### Branding
Apply the standard Rento design system with emphasis on trust and security visual elements. Include Japanese and English language support with cultural sensitivity for privacy communications.

### Target Device and Platforms
**Web Dashboard** - Administrative interfaces for compliance monitoring and management
**Mobile** - Basic user privacy controls integrated into main app interface

## Technical Requirements

### Feature Architecture (MVP)
The APPI Compliance Infrastructure requires a foundational security-first architecture built on Japanese cloud infrastructure with essential data residency controls. Key MVP architectural components include:

- **Data Residency Layer:** AWS Tokyo deployment with basic geographic boundary controls
- **Encryption Layer:** AES-256 encryption with standard Japanese key management
- **Audit Layer:** Essential logging system with 2-year retention and daily monitoring
- **Compliance Layer:** Basic policy enforcement with manual violation handling
- **Integration Layer:** Simple API gateway with manual regulatory reporting

### Deferred Architecture (Post-MVP)
- Advanced real-time monitoring and automated alerting
- Automated policy enforcement and escalation
- Integration with Japanese regulatory systems
- Advanced audit analytics and reporting

### Testing Requirements (MVP)
**Unit Testing:** Essential coverage for encryption, basic audit logging, and data residency validation
**Integration Testing:** Basic testing for core compliance functions and backup/recovery
**Compliance Testing:** Manual validation of APPI requirements with staging environment
**Load Testing:** Performance validation for 1,000 concurrent users within Japan infrastructure
**Security Testing:** Basic penetration testing meeting minimum Japanese security standards

### Deferred Testing (Post-MVP)
- Automated compliance testing with synthetic data
- Advanced load testing for 10,000+ users
- Comprehensive security audits meeting banking standards

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Legal counsel integration for ongoing compliance interpretation and policy updates
- Bilingual technical documentation for Japanese regulatory reporting requirements
- Partnership agreements with Japanese cloud providers for certified data residency guarantees
- Specialized monitoring tools compatible with Japan-region service limitations
- Cultural training materials for international staff working with Japanese regulatory requirements
- Contingency planning for regulatory requirement changes during development cycle
- Integration testing with representative Japanese real estate agency legacy systems

## Next Steps

### Architect Prompt
"Please create the MVP technical architecture for Rento's APPI Compliance Infrastructure using this FRD as input. Focus on essential Japan-specific deployment requirements, basic data residency controls, and minimal viable compliance infrastructure. Prioritize speed to market while maintaining legal compliance. Target ¥200K-300K monthly operational budget for MVP phase with clear scaling path to full requirements post-MVP. Rely on the user, a senior software engineer for tasks that require external setup of APIs and libraries."
