# Project Brief: Rento

## Executive Summary

Rento is a bilingual mobile rental property platform designed to transform the rental experience for foreign residents and international-minded Japanese renters in Japan. The platform combines modern technology with deep cultural expertise to bridge the gap between foreign residents seeking housing and Japanese real estate agents, solving critical pain points around language barriers, cultural navigation, and discrimination that existing platforms fail to address.

**Target Market:** 550,000+ foreign residents in Tokyo and tech-savvy Japanese professionals, representing a ¥65M annual revenue opportunity by Year 3.

**Key Value Proposition:** The only bilingual Japanese apartment rental platform. Rento simplifies the rental process, removes language and cultural barriers, and modernizes property discovery and communication — all in one unified platform.

**Business Model:** Dual revenue streams through agent subscription fees (¥15K-50K/month) and transaction fees (1-3% of annual rent), targeting 50 agent partnerships and 25,000 annual transactions by Year 3.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Japan's rental property market presents significant barriers for foreign residents that existing digital platforms fail to address:

**Language and Communication Barriers:**
- Existing platforms (SUUMO, LIFULL HOME'S) offer only basic translation without cultural context
- Real estate terminology and legal requirements are complex even for fluent Japanese speakers
- Agent communication requires nuanced cultural understanding beyond language translation

**Cultural Navigation Challenges:**
- Foreign residents struggle with Japanese rental customs (key money, guarantors, gift money systems)
- Lack of understanding about seasonal moving patterns, application processes, and relationship expectations
- Discrimination and cultural insensitivity from agents unprepared for international clients

**Service Quality Gaps:**
- No existing platform provides dedicated foreign customer service or cultural competency training for agents
- Traditional platforms assume cultural familiarity with Japanese business practices
- International-focused platforms have limited inventory and agent networks

### Impact Quantification

**Market Impact:**
- 260,000 foreign rental households in Tokyo face these challenges annually
- 40% turnover rate among foreign residents vs. 25% for Japanese residents (higher due to visa/job changes and housing dissatisfaction)
- Estimated ¥187 billion annual transaction value in foreign resident rental market

**Individual Impact:**
- Foreign renters pay 10-20% premium for English-capable services when available
- Average 2-4 weeks additional search time due to language and cultural barriers
- High stress and anxiety affecting work performance and life satisfaction in Japan

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Major Platform Limitations:**
- **SUUMO**: Dominant market share (45%) but no specialized international services, basic translation only
- **LIFULL HOME'S**: Advanced technology but no cultural navigation features despite international expansion experience
- **AtHome**: Traditional approach with no international capabilities whatsoever

**International Platform Constraints:**
- **GaijinPot/Plaza Homes**: Limited agent networks and property inventory, basic technology platforms
- **Corporate Relocation Services**: High-cost B2B only, not accessible to individual renters

**Service Gap Analysis:**
- No platform combines comprehensive bilingual service + modern technology + strong agent networks
- Cultural expertise treated as nice-to-have rather than core value proposition
- Agent training focuses on technology adoption rather than cultural competency

### Urgency and Market Timing

**Government Policy Tailwinds:**
- Japan actively recruiting foreign workers with expanded visa programs
- Target: 2M additional foreign workers by 2030
- Digital transformation initiatives creating openness to new platforms

**Market Timing Advantages:**
- Technology adoption lifecycle in early majority phase (30% digital penetration)
- 12-18 month window before major competitors develop comprehensive responses
- COVID-19 accelerated digital adoption reducing resistance to new platforms

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget**: Initial development budget of ¥15-25M for MVP development, ¥5-10M annual operational costs, conservative approach to venture funding until product-market fit validation
- **Timeline**: 12-month MVP development timeline, 18-month timeline to 50 agent partnerships, 24-month timeline to profitability and market validation
- **Resources**: Core team of 8-12 people including bilingual customer service, 2-3 senior developers, product manager, and business development specialists
- **Technical**: APPI compliance requirements constraining technology choices, self-hosting requirements increasing infrastructure costs, real estate licensing restrictions requiring agent partnerships rather than direct transactions

### Key Assumptions

- Foreign resident population in Tokyo continues growing at 3-5% annually driven by government immigration policies
- Real estate agents will adopt subscription-based SaaS models with appropriate training and value demonstration
- Cultural expertise and bilingual service quality justify 10-20% premium pricing over basic translation services
- Major competitors (SUUMO, LIFULL) will require 12-18 months to develop comprehensive competitive responses
- Self-hosting infrastructure costs remain predictable at ¥300K-500K monthly for compliance requirements
- Corporate partnerships will drive 30-40% of customer acquisition reducing direct marketing costs
- Technology talent for bilingual platform development available within budget constraints
- Regulatory environment remains stable with predictable APPI compliance requirements

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Competitive Response Risk**: SUUMO or LIFULL HOME'S could develop English services faster than anticipated, leveraging superior resources and established agent networks to compete directly
- **Agent Adoption Risk**: Real estate agents may resist new platform adoption or cultural competency training requirements, preferring traditional relationship-based business models
- **Market Demand Risk**: Foreign residents may not be willing to pay premium pricing for cultural services, or market size assumptions may be overstated
- **Regulatory Compliance Risk**: APPI compliance costs could exceed projections, or regulatory changes could require significant platform modifications
- **Technology Talent Risk**: Difficulty recruiting bilingual developers and cultural experts within budget constraints could delay development timelines
- **Economic Downturn Risk**: Recession or policy changes could reduce foreign resident population or rental market activity significantly
