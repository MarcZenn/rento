## Overview

# APPI Compliance Infrastructure - Technical Design Document

This Technical Design Document outlines the implementation of APPI (Act on Protection of Personal Information) compliance infrastructure for Rento's Japanese market operation. This foundational system enables legal data processing, establishes competitive barriers, and provides the security framework upon which all other platform features depend.

## Background Context

This is a Technical Design Document for APPI Compliance Infrastructure. It outlines the technical requirements and implementation details for establishing comprehensive data privacy and residency compliance for Rento's operation in Japan. It should serve as a guiding document for a SCRUM master to reference as they craft tickets in Archon that developers and engineers can then reference to implement APPI Compliance Infrastructure in the codebase.

This TDD is based on the APPI Compliance Infrastructure Feature Requirements Document (FRD), which establishes the business case, regulatory requirements, and MVP scope for Japan-compliant data processing infrastructure.

## Objective & Scope

### Summary

**Objective:** Establish APPI-compliant infrastructure that enables Rento's legal operation in Japan while creating competitive barriers and building agent trust.

**What it enables:** This feature enables Rento to legally process user data, handle real estate transactions, and build relationships with privacy-conscious Japanese real estate agents. It provides the foundational security and compliance layer upon which all other platform features depend.

**Why needed:** Without APPI compliance, Rento cannot legally operate in Japan's heavily regulated data privacy landscape. This infrastructure is mandatory for market entry and creates a ¥3-5M competitive barrier that protects market position once implemented.

## Architecture & Integrations

### Context Diagram

• APPI compliance infrastructure sits as foundational layer beneath all Rento platform services
• Current Convex cloud hosting must migrate to self-hosted AWS Tokyo deployment
• Current Clerk authentication requires migration to Auth0 by Okta which offers residency "cells" in Japan.
• All user data processing must occur within Japanese infrastructure boundaries
• Real estate agents and users interact through compliance-controlled data flows
• Audit and monitoring systems provide regulatory reporting capability
• Backup and disaster recovery systems maintain compliance while ensuring availability

### Data Flow Overview

1. User authenticates via Auth0 identity provider → System validates within JP boundaries
2. User consent check performed against local consent database → Missing consent triggers consent modal
3. On consent submission → Consent service writes records to encrypted JP storage + audit log created
4. All user data operations validated against consent permissions → Unauthorized access blocked
5. Data processing events logged to encrypted audit system → Compliance dashboard updated
6. Backup operations execute within AWS Tokyo region → No cross-border data transfer
7. Incident detection triggers internal alerts → Manual regulatory reporting initiated if required
8. User data deletion requests → Automated purge across all JP systems within 1-hour SLA

### Integration Points

- hook: "All data operations → encrypt at rest and in transit"
- constraint: "Key management must comply with Japanese banking standards"

**audit:**
- provider: "Custom audit logging system"
- hook: "All data access events → encrypted log storage with 2-year retention"
- constraint: "Audit trails must support regulatory reporting requirements"

**Phase 2: Data Migration and Validation (Week 3-4)**
- Migrate existing user data to Japanese infrastructure with encryption at rest
- Transfer Convex database to self-hosted instance with data integrity verification
- Migrate user authentication from Clerk to Auth0 by Okta, which offers residency "cells" in Japan, with staged rollout
- Implement consent collection system for existing users with granular APPI compliance options
- Deploy compliance dashboard for monitoring migration progress and detecting violations

**Phase 3: Application Integration (Week 5-6)**
- Integrate mobile app with new APPI compliance APIs and consent validation systems
- Deploy frontend consent management interfaces with EN/JP localization
- Implement data deletion request workflows with 1-hour SLA capability
- Deploy compliance notification systems for policy updates and incident communications
- Conduct comprehensive testing of all compliance workflows with representative user data

**Phase 4: Compliance Validation and Go-Live (Week 7-8)**
